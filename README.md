#### Hype Template, Hype Symbol or Only Resources

When exporting your Illustrator file to Hype, you have three options for the type of file you want to create: Hype Template, Hype Symbol, or Only Resources.

* **Hype Template:** This option creates a new Hype document using your Illustrator file as a template. The layers and groups in your Illustrator file will be converted into corresponding elements in Hype, such as divs or images. This option is useful if you want to create a new Hype project based on your Illustrator design.

* **Hype Symbol:** This option exports your Illustrator file as a reusable Hype Symbol, which is a group of elements that can be used repeatedly in your Hype project. When you drag a Hype Symbol into your Hype project, it will retain its original properties and animations. This option is useful if you want to create a reusable element for your Hype project.

* **Only Resources:** This option exports only the resources used in your Illustrator file and doesn't update or create a Hype file. This option is useful if you want to update the resources in your Hype project or just want to relink a file.

Each of these options has its own benefits, depending on your specific needs. Consider the purpose of your project and choose the option that best fits your requirements. 

*If you're just getting started with Hype and have an existing Illustrator file, it's a good idea to start with a Hype Template. This option allows you to easily import your Illustrator design into Hype and start building your project without having to recreate everything from scratch. With the layers and text already in place, you can quickly add animations and interactions to your design.*
